    <p class="event-text">
      A huge weekend for the local skimboarding community as riders gathered at East Coast Park
      for the 2025 Premier Skimboard League. With perfect weather and a strong turnout,
      competitors battled it out on clean shorebreaks with plenty of fast lines, wraps, and big airs.
    </p>

    <p class="event-text">
      The day started early with warm-ups and practice runs. As the tide filled in, the waves began
      shaping perfectly against the shoreline, giving riders the chance to showcase their best tricks.
      Crowds gathered quickly and the atmosphere turned electric as heats progressed.
    </p>

    <p class="event-text">
      It was an unforgettable event with impressive performances, new friendships, and a strong
      showing of support from the entire skim community. Stay tuned for more events coming soon!
